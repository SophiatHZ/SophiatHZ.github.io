                    <p> Hi, I’m Sophia, I’m 18 years old and I live in Burgh-Haamstede, a quiet town close to the beach.
                        I’m studying HBO-ICT at HZ University of Applied Sciences in Middelburg. I’ve been into
                        computers for as long as I can remember. When I was younger, I spent hours playing games,
                        changing parts in my laptop or PC, and just messing around to see what would happen. I didn’t
                        always know what I was doing, but I loved figuring things out. As I got older, I started
                        wondering more about how computers actually work and what’s going on “behind the scenes” when
                        you run a program. That curiosity is what made me want to learn programming, and now I get to
                        study it for real.

                    <div class="topic">Hobbies</div>
                    <p>When I’m not busy with school, I like doing a lot of different things. I listen to music
                        pretty much every day sometimes just in the background, sometimes really paying attention to
                        every little detail in a song. Gaming is one of my favorite ways to relax, and I especially like
                        when a game has a beautiful, meaningful story that really sticks with you. I love thrifting
                        because it feels like a treasure hunt you never know what cool or weird stuff you’re going to
                        find. Baking and cooking are also things I really enjoy, especially when I’m trying out a new
                        recipe. Sometimes it goes perfectly, sometimes not… but it’s always fun. And of course, I watch
                        a lot of movies.
