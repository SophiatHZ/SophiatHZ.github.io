            <h2>Before the study</h2>
            <p>When I was around 10 years old, I was already really curious about computers. My parents thought it was a
                bit unusual because they thought stuff like that was more for boys, haha. I didn’t really know much
                about programming yet, but I always wondered how computers and games worked. I even wanted to make my
                own Roblox game back then, but I quickly got stuck with the programming part. Now they are proud that
                I’m studying HBO-ICT and following my interest in technology.</p>

            <h2>Why I chose this study</h2>
            <p>I chose HBO-ICT because I wanted to turn my curiosity about computers into real skills. I’ve always loved
                exploring how programs and games work, and now I get to learn coding and understand software and
                hardware properly. This study feels like the perfect way to follow my passion for technology and work
                towards making my own projects maybe even games in the future.</p>
